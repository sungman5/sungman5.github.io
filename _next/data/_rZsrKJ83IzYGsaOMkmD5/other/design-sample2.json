{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"design-sample2","contentHtml":"<p>We recommend using <strong>Static Generation</strong> (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.</p>\n<p>You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marketing pages</li>\n<li>Blog posts</li>\n<li>E-commerce product listings</li>\n<li>Help and documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page <strong>ahead</strong> of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Static Generation is <strong>not</strong> a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.</p>\n<p>In that case, you can use <strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong>. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.</p>\n","title":"디자인포스팅2","date":"2020-01-02","excerpt":"새침하게 흐린 품이 눈이 올 듯하더니 눈은 아니 오고 얼다가 만 비가 추적추적 내리었다. 이날이야말로 동소문 안에서 인력거꾼 노릇을 하는 김 첨지에게는 오래간만에도 닥친 운수 좋은 날이었다."}},"__N_SSG":true}
